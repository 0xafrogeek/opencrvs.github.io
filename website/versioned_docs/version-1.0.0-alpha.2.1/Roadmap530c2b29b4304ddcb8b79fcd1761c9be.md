- User notifications? Haven't really done designs yet. but could be good one to show off. Mobile locked screen showing a notification from OpenCRVS. "You have 4 more applications to review'.
- Append signature before clicking 'review' by reg agent, on 'register' by Registrar. ?
- Examples of making the form smarter
  - IF FA input NID then we don't show any of the other fields. Do NID validation and populate the application when it lands on the Reg agents workqueue.
  - Address input updates
  - Prototype question by question example? test and time how long it takes to complete. show that it is quicker! "i'm sure!" mimic the interaction expected by FA when completing. asking the question to the applicant and then entering the answer
- Mobile optimisation

  - tables

- Dialog or toast prompt on review page to remind them to review the application with the applicant. Instead of having the copy in page above the heading Application details.
