- Able to create birth and death registration applications using a tablet/mobile device and send these for review by registration staff

### Workqueues

The Field Agent sees 3 work-queues to help them effectively manage their workload:

1. **In progress:** any draft applications that they have started and not completed. From this workqueue, the field agent can complete and submit the application.
2. **Sent for review:** any applications that they have submitted for review (complete with all mandatory information) or for follow-up (without all mandatory information).
3. **Require updates:** any applications that they have submitted that have been rejected by the Registrar because something is wrong with the application. The field agent can see what updates are required and can advise the applicant to go to the registration office to make necessary updates.
