### Workqueues

The Registrar sees 5 work-queues to help them effectively manage their workload:

1. **In Progress:**

- Any draft applications that they have started and not completed.
- Any in-progress applications (without all mandatory fields completed) that they have received from field agents.
- Any notifications that they have received from health facilities and existing healthy systems e.g. DHIS2.

From this workqueue, the registration agent can complete and submit the application.

2. **Ready for review:** any applications that have been submitted for review (complete with all mandatory information) from field agents.

For offices where a **Registration Agent** reviews applications before the Registrar, the Registrar can see this review has been completed when the record is marked with the below green tick.

3. **Sent for updates:** any applications that require updates before registration i.e. rejected with a reason - this requires follow-up over the phone or in-person.

4. **Ready to print:** any applications that have been registered by the Registrar and the certificate is ready to print and be issued.

### **Example Users**

**Union Parishad Secretary - Registrar, Bangladesh**

Likhon is a UP Secretary in Joymonirhat Union Parishad, Bhurungamari, Bangladesh. He is passionate about all of the public services that he is responsible for and is always looking for better ways of doing things. He is happy using OpenCRVS because "the service is taken to those that live far from this office. Using the system I can see all the details and documents and register the birth or death here, before they travel here, only once!".
