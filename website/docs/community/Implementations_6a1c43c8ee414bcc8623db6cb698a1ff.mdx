### ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡² Zambia

A proof of concept was developed in Zambia to demonstrate the product's viability as an ICT asset for the African continent. At the 5th Conference of Ministers responsible for CRVS in Africa, the Zambian version of OpenCRVS was showcased and received positive feedback as it responds directly to Resolution 19 of the Nouakchott Declaration which called for the "development of common ICT assets to support effective CRVS systems across Africa".

Martin Nyahoda, Deputy Registrar General in Zambia said: "OpenCRVS is smart, it's a smart way of doing registration and I believe that if countries explore it, it's got the potential to improve service delivery and raise their registration coverage."
