The value of open-source products as digital public goods is that an active community of contributors will help to maintain and grow the product.

We need your support to ensure that every individual on the planet is recognised, protected and provided for from birth.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)
