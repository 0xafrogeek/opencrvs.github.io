## Our development process

OpenCRVS uses [GitHub](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core) as its source of truth. The core team will be working directly there. All changes will be public from the beginning.

### Reporting new issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues) if you would like to raise a bug or propose a change or feature. If you just have a general topic of discussion, or would like some technical help, please chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/opencrvs/community).

### Reporting bugs

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues) for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it, or chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/opencrvs/community). If you are certain this is a new, unreported bug, you can submit a bug report.

Take screenshots or record your screen. [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is a great tool you can use to record a video and paste a link to it into your bug. Open a bug report on [Github](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%91%B9Bug&template=---bug.md&title=) following the guidance.

### Reporting security bugs

Make sure to include a detailed description of the bug. Open a bug report on [Github](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%91%B9Bug&template=---bug.md&title=) following the guidance.
