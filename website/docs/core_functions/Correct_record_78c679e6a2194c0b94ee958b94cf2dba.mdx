# Correct record

# Overview

This functionality allows:

- A [**Registration Agent**](../system_overview/user_types/registrationAgent) to submit a correction request to the Registrar with all required supporting documentation
- A [**Registrar**](../system_overview/user_types/registrar) to review and formally request the correction by the relevant authority.

In Bangladesh, the Registration Agent (data clerk/Union Digital Centre officer) can complete the request, it must be reviewed by the Registrar (Chairman or Secretary), and it is then sent for approval (at which point it will be updated and a record of the change made in the system) by the UNO.

## Configuration

Different levels of approval can be added and removed to make the correction process as efficient as possible.

_Recommended:_ Request sent from one actor and approved by the one with authority. Minimal steps, with each action audited.

## User Stories

## _Coming Soon_

### Correction Request

The user is requested to identify:

1. Who is making the correction request so that there is evidence of the requestor and their ID.
2. Why they are making the change.

    "assets/core_functions/Correct_record_78c679e6a2194c0b94ee958b94cf2dba/Reason_for_correction.png"
  )}
/>

The user is then prompted to submit the correction request(s), review the request(s) and submit it for approval.

### Process the correction request

The Registrar finds correction requests in their workqueue and can review and submit them for approval to the Registration Manager.

The Registration Manager finds correction requests in their workqueue and can review, approve or reject the request. Whatever the outcome, this appears in the relevant Registrar's workqueue to allow them to action/follow up as required.

Every correction request, update made or rejected is captured in the audit function.
