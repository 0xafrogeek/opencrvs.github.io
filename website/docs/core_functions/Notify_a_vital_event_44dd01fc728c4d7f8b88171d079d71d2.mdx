This functionality allows a [**Registration Agent**](../system_overview/user_types/registrationAgent) or a [**Registrar**](../system_overview/user_types/registrar) to view birth and death notifications sent from external health facilities. These notifications appear in in the "In-Progress" workqueue as they require follow up work to complete all mandatory fields.

## Configuration

Notifications can be received from any external system and an additional workqueue can be added so that users know where the notification came from.

In Bangladesh, OpenCRVS receives notifications from DHIS2.

  )}

### View incomplete applications sent from the field

Registration Agents and Registrars can see notifications sent from field agents that do not have all mandatory information included in the _In-progress_ workqueue. They can also see which agent sent the incomplete application, when and from where.

### Complete notification

From this workqueue the user can download the notification, review the information provided, and update it with the information required to submit it as a complete application or register it. To encourage active follow-up, they can see the contact number of the Applicant in the workqueue, it is then their responsibility to follow-up with the Applicant to complete the mandatory information and get supporting documents.
