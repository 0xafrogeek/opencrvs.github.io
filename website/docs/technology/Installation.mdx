This document outlines the steps a developer should take to set up a local development environment of OpenCRVS.

**OpenCRVS Core** source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core).
A companion example configuration; the OpenCRVS **resources** package for Zambia, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-zambia).

Both **OpenCRVS Core** and a **resources** package are required to run OpenCRVS. When you configure OpenCRVS for your country, you will need to duplicate and configure your own **resources** package.

## Preparing for installation

- Read the [Introduction](./technologyIntroduction)
- OpenCRVS uses some exciting tools. Take some time to understand the OpenSource [dependencies](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core#what-are-the-key-opensource-dependencies-of-opencrvs).

When you clone the **OpenCRVS Core** [repo](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core), you are downloading:

- All of our microservices and the mobile, progressive web application as [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) packages.
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) files to run a development environment and deploy OpenCRVS.
- An Infrastructure folder, containing [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) setup, [OpenHIM](http://openhim.org/) [configuration](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/blob/master/infrastructure/openhim-base-config.json), [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) configuration, [Hearth](https://github.com/jembi/hearth) plugins, [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) configuration, [Traefik]https://containo.us/traefik/ configuration and a number of essential scripts required to automate deployment, netweorking and backup.

Now, take some time to understand the directory structure. Read more about what all the packages are for [here](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core#what-is-inside-the-opencrvs-packages).

Now you are ready to follow the step-by-step [development environment installation](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core#ok-how-do-i-set-up-a-development-environment) instructions. At a high level you will be required to:

- Install some basic dependencies for your workstation.
- Clone the repo and install some application dependencies.
- Run a single command to start **OpenCRVS Core** and the OpenCRVS **resources** module in Docker on your workstation
- Install a base configuration for OpenHIM
- Populate your local Mongo DB with reference data and test users for the Zambia configuration.

If you have any issues, we would love to know so that we can improve our documentation. Please talk to us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/opencrvs/community#). There is a link at the foot of this page.
