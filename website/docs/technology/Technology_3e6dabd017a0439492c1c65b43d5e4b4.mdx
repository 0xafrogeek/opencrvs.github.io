This section provides an in-depth background of:

- The technical architecture of OpenCRVS.
- The [installation process](./installation) required to set up a development environment.
- The [technical configuration process](./technicalConfiguration) required to set up OpenCRVS for your country.
- Information on how to make OpenCRVS [interoperate](./technicalInteroperability) with external systems such as National ID, Health etc.
- The process and methodologies required to [deploy](./deployment) OpenCRVS in production.

## Architecture

The technical architecture of OpenCRVS was designed to conform to the [OpenHIE](https://ohie.org/) architectural standard and [FHIR](https://hl7.org/FHIR/).

The Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) initiative is a global, mission-driven community of practice. Dedicated to improving the health of the underserved through open and collaborative development & interoperable data standards

The OpenHIE framework supports interoperability by creating a reusable architectural framework that introduces a service oriented approach, maximally leveraging health information standards, enabling flexible implementation by country partners, and supporting interchangeability of individual components.

OpenCRVS architecture follows the OpenHIE framework by:

- Utilising the OpenHIE reference interoperability middleware: [OpenHIM](http://openhim.org/).
- Being constructed using modular, interchangeable, event-driven microservices for business functions and by utilising [FHIR](https://hl7.org/FHIR/) in a NoSQL MongoDB datastore: [Hearth](https://github.com/jembi/hearth).
- Providing scalablility via a [one Docker container per microservice](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/best-practices-for-building-containers) model and [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).
- Being fully configurable using simple text files.

OpenCRVS builds on these sound principles by additionally providing:

- A market-leading, powerful search and de-duplication engine powered by [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/).
- Real time performance analytics powered by the time-series database: [Influx](https://www.influxdata.com).
- Increased performance via vastly reduced HTTP requests between client and server through the use of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- A [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) continuous integration and delivery suite containing 80%+ coverage of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit tests, [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) end-to-end tests and integration tests.
- A full-stack designed for the lowest possible TCO, "total cost of ownership" - built in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) / JavaScript (NodeJS - [HapiJS](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) & [React](https://reactjs.org/)) - using [Progressive Web Application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) technology for offline and low-connectivity access via mobile.
- External server and application health monitoring with [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/), [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/), [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/), [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/) and [Sentry](https://sentry.io) configurations.
- Automatic [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL configuration and microservice cloud router using [Traefik]https://containo.us/traefik/
- Peace of mind, with the understanding that OpenCRVS has been security tested to UK government standards, by an independent [CREST](https://www.crest-approved.org/) and [CyberEssentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) certified organisation.

## Interoperability via OpenHIM and FHIR

You can read more about the [functional interoperability requirements](../system_overview/interoperability) and the technical interoperability process [here](./technicalInteroperability).

## Scalability

OpenCRVS is vertically scalable from the smallest to the largest nation. Our pilot is live in Bangladesh a country with a huge population. It can be distributedly deployed on public or private cloud servers across multiple nodes, or installed in a small data centre on a single node and easily managed and maintained by a very small team.

Read more about the [deployment process](./deployment).

## Configuration

It is easy to configure and localise using a number of config text files in a resources package. A companion example configuration; the OpenCRVS **Resources** package for Zambia, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-zambia).

You can read more about the [functional configuration requirements](../system_overview/configuration) and the technical configuration process [here](./technicalConfiguration).

## Security & Backup

Our mobile application and microservices are secure, protected by [2-Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) utilising [OAuth JWT best practices](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp-02.html).
You can read about this process [here](../support_functions/login)

[User types](../system_overview/user_types/overviewUserTypes) and access controls are managed in order to segregate personally identifiable data to only to the users who need it. These configurations can be managed in the [admin](../system_admin/userTeam) system, thus protecting citizen rights.

All OpenCRVS data is encrypted in transit and at rest. OpenCRVS includes daily, automated, external back up as a configurable option in our [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) script. Our system has been security tested to UK government standards by an independent, [CREST](https://www.crest-approved.org/) and [CyberEssentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) certified organisation.
