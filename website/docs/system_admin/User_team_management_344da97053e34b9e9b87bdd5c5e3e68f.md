The functionality supports essential system administration activities, managing both users and teams in the system.

## Configuration

Standard user roles are defined in [User types](../system_overview/user_types/overviewUserTypes). If you want to change these user types, this will require customisation.

The details required for each user can be configured as per country requirements.

## User Stories

- As a **System Administrator,** I want to be able to add users to the system so that they can conduct their activities
- As a **System Administrator,** I want to be able to edit user details so that they are always up to date and the user can access the application as and when needed
- As a **System Administrator,** I want to be able to be able to view all users from the same office so that I can see who works there **[in roadmap]**
- As a **System Administrator,** I want to be able to see which users are active and which users are no longer active so that I know who is working in a specific office
- As a **Registrar,** I want to be able to be able to view all users in my office so that only active users have access to the application **[in roadmap]**
- As a **Registrar**, I want to be able to request the creation of a new user so that they can quickly get to work **[in roadmap]**
- As a **Registrar,** I want to be able to request to deactivate users who no longer work on civil registration so that they can't conduct activities when they don't have an official role **[in roadmap]**
