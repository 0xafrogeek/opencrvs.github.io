This functionality allows you to easily manage the content (copy) of the application, including managing multiple languages.

## Configuration

All product copy can be edited as per country requirements.

## User Stories

As a **System Administrator,** I want to be able to easily manage the content of the OpenCRVS application, so that I can focus on value add activities

## Functionality

Currently, all content management is completed in the code by creating it in the country's resources package: [https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-zambia#languages---how-do-i-internationalise-or-update-the-opencrvs-client-text](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-zambia#languages---how-do-i-internationalise-or-update-the-opencrvs-client-text)

You can edit content by editing the following text file: [https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-zambia/blob/master/src/zmb/features/languages/generated/register.json](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-zambia/blob/master/src/zmb/features/languages/generated/register.json)

#**Coming Soon**

If OpenCRVS requires central management in the future, we will use an existing content management system (CMS) e.g. Contentful or Transifex
